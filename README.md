## Overview

### The Challenge
Build a clean and responsive **Ticket Generator** app that allows users to generate, customize, and manage tickets dynamically using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form with their details
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - Any field is missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - The avatar upload is too big or the wrong image format
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, form field hints, and error messages announced on their screen reader
- See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built With
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- Google Fonts  
- Font Awesome  

### What I Learned
This project empowered me to improve my **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **UI structuring** using clean, modular JavaScript. I also leveled up in creating responsive layouts and enhancing UX through subtle interactions.

### Continued Development
In future iterations, I plan to:
- Add form validation  
- Generate downloadable tickets (PDF)  
- Store ticket data in localStorage or a backend  
- Improve mobile responsiveness with Tailwind CSS
